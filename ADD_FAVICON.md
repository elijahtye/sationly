# Add Favicon to Sationly

## 📋 Steps to Add Your Favicon

### Step 1: Save Your Image File

1. **Save your image** as one of these formats:
   - `favicon.png` (recommended - 32x32 or 64x64 pixels)
   - `favicon.ico` (traditional format)
   - `favicon.svg` (scalable vector)

2. **Place it in the project root**: `/Users/elijahtye/Learning/favicon.png`

### Step 2: Update HTML Files

I'll update all HTML files to reference your favicon once you have the file saved.

### Step 3: Deploy

After adding the file:
```bash
git add favicon.png
git add *.html  # (if HTML files were updated)
git commit -m "Add favicon"
git push origin main
```
